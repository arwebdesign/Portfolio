                    <p class="sectPara">This header and CTA is very interesting. The background image changes on a slide effect to the left, and the menu bar moves up while scrolling and remains fixed at the top once it gets there. <br><br>I'm pretty sure this will require some jQuery to create such effects, but I like the idea of fixed menus, I believe they are more powerful than a menu that disappears while scrolling.</p>
                    <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in wdd:</h3>
                    <p class="sectPara">I have already done some galleries that rotate as this one, but they all require some additional libraries, so I am not sure of the creation of such effects using just HTML and CSS. When it comes to the menu bar, I know it can be fixed through CSS, but I don't know if it is possible to make it scrollable and then fixed at the top.</p>

                    <p class="sectPara">I chose this one because it shows one of the things I have struggle with. Putting text next to an image. In this case it is done for various services so it is a great example.</p>
                    <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in wdd:</h3>
                    <p class="sectPara">I really hope to learn how to make this kind of list, either one column or various. My main purpose is to learn how to float the image or text to make it appear next to each other, I have tried it many times, but havenâ€™t been successful with the result. </p>
                    <h3>How I think this is done:</h3>

                        <img id="compImg" src="images/featuresList.jpg">                                 
                    </div>
                    <p class="sectPara">1. Create the component as a 'section'.<br>2. Add a heading 'h2' or 'h3'.<br>3. Create two un-ordered lists.<br>4. float them to left and rigth.<br>5. Inside each list component, add an 'img' and a 'p'.<br>6. Float each to left and right.

                    <h3>What I hope to Practice/learn:</h3>
                    <p class="sectPara">I liked this blog post because is very representative of what a post in many websites looks like, and not only for blogs. It has similarities to a Facebook, Tweeter or Instagram post. There are components inside it that I think are important: Title, owner, date, views and comments. It also has some buttons at the bottom that add more capability.</p>
                    <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in wdd:</h3>
                    <p class="sectPara">There are so many little things that are part of this post that it seems difficult to organize. I would like to learn how to add all of these and make it look right.</p>

                    <p class="sectPara">This is a very simple footer that is quite direct to the point for the purpose of a portfolio. I think that adding a "contact" form on top of it could make it even more useful.</p>
                    <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in wdd:</h3>
                    <p class="sectPara">So far, footers have not given me to much trouble, but it is always nice to see how each part of comes to reality in organized way.</p>
